# JavaScript Practice Exercises

This repository contains more than 70 JavaScript exercises designed to improve your problem-solving skills using fundamental concepts such as loops, conditions, string manipulation, object manipulation, and arrays.  
You are **not allowed** to use **map**, **filter**, **reduce**, or **Object.keys/Object.values/Object.entries**.  
Only `for`, `while`, and standard logic must be used.

The exercises are categorized based on their **difficulty level** and **concept**.

# Bonus Challenges
- Validate if a full name contains numbers and reject invalid entries.
- Create a nested object showing employees grouped by both department and project.
- Create a function to simulate a simple search: return employees whose name includes a keyword.
- Simulate a mini authentication system where you match an employee’s login and password manually (without real security).

# Notes
- Focus on using only loops and conditions.
- Avoid using advanced array methods unless explicitly required.
- Try to optimize your code for readability and clarity.
